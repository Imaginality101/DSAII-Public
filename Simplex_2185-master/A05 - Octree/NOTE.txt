Controls:

The controls that Alberto had set up (page up/down and numberpad +/-) all work with their intended functions.

I also added in two other controls. 
* [Left Shift] will set up the optimal octree and display it.
* [Right Shift] will turn off all octree optimization and display nothing (but the objects).
